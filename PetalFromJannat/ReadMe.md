## Introduction
Petals from Jannat is a responsive ecommerce website for a floral business, designed to provide customers with an intuitive online shopping experience for fresh flowers and arrangements. The website serves as a digital storefront, enabling users to browse products, learn about the company, and make inquiries through an accessible interface.

## Key Features
The website offers a complete shopping experience with five main pages: Home, Shop, About, Contact, and Cart. The responsive design ensures optimal viewing across devices, using CSS Grid for layout organisation. Product categories are presented through image cards with hover effects, and the shopping cart includes quantity selection and price calculation. The contact form features validation and interactive styling, while consistent navigation and branding are maintained throughout all pages.

## Technologies Used

- Implements modern web techniques including CSS Variables for consistent theming and CSS Grid for responsive layouts.
- Adheres to accessibility guidelines with proper alt tags and ARIA labels.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for reliable deployment.

## Lessons Learned
Developing Petals from Jannat provided practical experience in creating a multi-page website with consistent navigation and styling. The project emphasised the importance of mobile-first design, with challenges in maintaining visual consistency across different screen sizes. Implementing the cart interface taught valuable lessons about user flow design, while creating reusable CSS components improved efficiency in styling.

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include adding product filtering options in the shop section and implementing a checkout system. Future versions could benefit from integrating a backend for order processing and adding user account functionality. There's also potential to expand the product catalogue and include seasonal collections with dynamic content loading.
